--- abstract

This document defines an HTTP Proxy-Status Parameter that contains a list of aliases
and canonical names received over DNS when establishing a connection to the next hop.

# Introduction

The Proxy-Status HTTP response field {{!PROXY-STATUS=RFC9209}} allows proxies to convey
information about how a proxied request was handled in HTTP responses sent to clients.
It defines a set of parameters that provide information, such as the name of the next
hop.

{{!PROXY-STATUS=RFC9209}} defines a `next-hop` parameter, which can contain a hostname,
IP address, or alias of the next hop. This parameter can contain only one such item,
so it cannot be used to communicate a chain of aliases encountered during DNS resolution
when connecting to the next hop.

Knowing the full chain of names that were used during DNS resolution via CNAME records
{{!DNS=RFC1034}} is particularly useful for clients of forward proxies, in which the
client is requesting to connect to a specific target hostname using the CONNECT method
{{!HTTP=RFC9110}} or UDP proxying {{!CONNECT-UDP=RFC9298}}. CNAME records can be used to
"cloak" hosts that perform tracking or malicious activity behind more innocuous hostnames,
and clients such as web browsers use the chain of DNS names to influence behavior like cookie
usage policies {{?COOKIES=RFC6265}} or blocking of malicious hosts.

This document allows clients to receive the CNAME chain of DNS names for the next hop
by including the list of names in a new `next-hop-aliases` Proxy-Status parameter.

## Requirements

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# next-hop-aliases Parameter {#parameter}

The `next-hop-aliases` parameter's value is a String that contains one or more DNS names in
a comma-separated list. The items in the list include all alias names and canonical names
received in CNAME records {{DNS}} during the course of resolving the next hop's
hostname using DNS, not including the original requested hostname itself. The names SHOULD
appear in the order in which they were received in DNS. If there are multiple CNAME records
in the chain, the first name in the `next-hop-aliases` list would be the value in the CNAME
record for the original hostname, and the final name in the `next-hop-aliases` list would
be the name that ultimately resolved to one or more addresses.

The list of DNS names in `next-hop-aliases` use a comma (",") as a separator between names.
DNS names normally just contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens ("-"), although they
are allowed to contain any character {{?RFC1035, Section 3.1}}, including a comma. To
prevent commas or other special characters in names leading to incorrect parsing,
any characters that appear in names in this list that do not belong to the set of URI
Unreserved Characters {{!RFC3986, Section 2.3}} MUST be percent-encoded as
defined in {{!RFC3986, Section 2.1}}.

For example, consider a proxy "proxy.example.net" that receives the following records when
performing DNS resolution for the next hop "host.example.com":

~~~ dns-example
host.example.com.           CNAME   tracker.example.com.
tracker.example.com.        CNAME   service1.example-cdn.com.
service1.example-cdn.com.   AAAA    2001:db8::1
~~~

The proxy could include the following proxy status in its response:

~~~ example
Proxy-Status: proxy.example.net; next-hop=2001:db8::1;
    next-hop-aliases="tracker.example.com,service1.example-cdn.com"
~~~

This indicates that proxy.example.net, which used the IP address "2001:db8::1" as the next hop
for this request, encountered the names "tracker.example.com" and "service1.example-cdn.com"
in the DNS resolution chain. Note that while this example includes both the `next-hop` and
`next-hop-aliases` parameters, `next-hop-aliases` can be included without including `next-hop`.

The `next-hop-aliases` parameter only applies when DNS was used to resolve the next hop's name, and
does not apply in all situations. Clients can use the information in this parameter to determine
how to use the connection established through the proxy, but need to gracefully handle situations
in which this parameter is not present.

The proxy MAY send the empty string ("") as the value of `next-hop-aliases` to indicate that
no CNAME records were encountered when resolving the next hop's name.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

The `next-hop-aliases` parameter does not include any DNSSEC information or imply that DNSSEC was used.
The information included in the parameter can only be trusted to be valid insofar as the client
trusts its proxy to provide accurate information. This information is intended to be used as
a hint, and SHOULD NOT be used for making security decisions about the identity of a resource accessed
through the proxy.

# IANA Considerations

in the "HTTP Proxy-Status Parameters" registry

Description:
: A string containing one or more DNS aliases or canonical names used to establish a
proxied connection to the next hop.
